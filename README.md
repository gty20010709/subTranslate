通过将上下文和当前需要翻译的字幕相联系， 让AI给出恰当的翻译。
我之前所接触过的字幕翻译工具，往往缺乏联系上下文的能力。此程序翻译出来的字幕，人工修订一下，就可以使用了。


```srt

00:00:00,066 --> 00:00:01,933
when you were born through the birth canal

2
00:00:01,933 --> 00:00:04,066
countless bacteria covered your body

3
00:00:04,066 --> 00:00:05,533
they'll be with you throughout your life

4
00:00:05,533 --> 00:00:07,800
