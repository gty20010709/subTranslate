1
00:00:00,066 --> 00:00:01,933
when you were born through the birth canal

2
00:00:01,933 --> 00:00:04,066
countless bacteria covered your body

3
00:00:04,066 --> 00:00:05,533
they'll be with you throughout your life

4
00:00:05,533 --> 00:00:07,800
if you were born by caesarian section

5
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:09,733
you're more likely to develop asthma

6
00:00:09,733 --> 00:00:11,066
or immune diseases

7
00:00:11,066 --> 00:00:13,400
our mother's breast milk contains a special sugar

8
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:14,966
 that feeds specific microbial species

9
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:18,466
which help regulate our immune system 

10
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:19,100
it generally

11
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:22,133
takes two years for a Newborn to develop a complete

12
00:00:22,166 --> 00:00:23,566
healthy microbiome

13
00:00:23,566 --> 00:00:25,466
each person's microbiome is unique

14
00:00:25,466 --> 00:00:26,533
they come from your phone

15
00:00:26,533 --> 00:00:28,466
to your hands and then all over your body

16
00:00:28,466 --> 00:00:30,366
even inside your mouth is full of them

17
00:00:30,366 --> 00:00:32,133
yet we have little control over them

18
00:00:32,133 --> 00:00:33,300
for millions of years

19
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:35,500
humans made a pact with these microbes

20
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:37,066
we provide food and shelter

21
00:00:37,066 --> 00:00:39,100
and in return they work for us
